# BLACK_AMERICAN_TEXT
The objective of this document remains academic and personal. It is academic in the sense that it can provide materials for people to discuss the contents and the code. It is destined as a tutorial due to fact the guidelines used to conduct the litteray study of the texts of some African-American authors might be helpful for those who would like to analyse authors found in the gutenberg project.
The  personal part of this piece of work is to be able to give proof of my ability to use R programming for text mining.
